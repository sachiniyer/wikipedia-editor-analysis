# Wikipedia Editor Analysis

The goal of this project is to find out how much wikipedia editors stray from their most prolific domain of knowledge.

To do this we will first do topic analysis on each article in wikipedia, and then attach those topics (and their weight of importance on the page) to the editors of that page. This will all be stored in a centralized database. Then we will go through the database and for each editor calculate the variance of the topics that they edit.
