# Plan for analysis

## Part one

We would like to identify the similarities between pages, and create a way to
score similarity between different documents.
We aim to do this by doing some sort of graph analysis and cluster documents
into different domains.
## Part two

We would like to find the breadth of domains that wikipedia editors have. For
example, is an editor sticking to mathematical topics, or is that editor editing
pages from mathematics to tv shows.

# Teammates
